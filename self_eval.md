# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- It is useful to use a conditional in code when there is a true or false question being asked. -
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- What I would do differently is not to overthink the process and slow it down. -
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- Well I would say what brought me the most satisfaction is getting it done. I like to rush things and always make mistakes. Slowing it down will be key to my success and taking my time to read the question properly and formualting a plan of attack.
